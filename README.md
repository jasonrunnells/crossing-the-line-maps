# Crossing the Line â€“ Vessel Track Maps

This project visualizes vessel tracks that cross into Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the Channel Islands region, with a focus on Anacapa Island. The maps are designed to highlight patterns of human activity within protected marine zones.

Built with Leaflet and custom GeoJSON data, the maps display:
- 2023 vessel track lines
- MPA boundaries and classifications
- Spatial context around Anacapa and nearby islands

These visualizations aim to support awareness, education, and potential monitoring of vessel behavior in ecologically sensitive waters.
